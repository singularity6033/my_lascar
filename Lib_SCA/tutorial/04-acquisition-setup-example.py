"""
In this script we will show how to set up an AbstractContainer, dedicated to emulate a (dummy) side-channel acquisition setup.

The context here is the use of lascar for the acquisition phase.

Say we are targeting a device running an AES, that we can drive through a python class Dut (for Device Under Test).
This class has a method that commands the device to run the targeted operation, and returns the plaintext/ciphertext.

Beside, we have an Oscilloscope class, which returns the power measurement of the device through the method.

We create a class AcquisitionSetup, inheriting from AbstractContainer, and override the generate_trace() method which will request both device and oscilloscope.
