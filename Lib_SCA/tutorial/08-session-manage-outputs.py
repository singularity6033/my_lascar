"""

In side-channel, output management is crucial.

You process large amount of data, compute statistics on them, and then ...

Then ... what to do with the results?
- extract only the most substantial info (ie the secret key)
- extract the info for all guesses
- monitor the progression of your attack
- visualize the results?
- write them into a file?
- what kind of visualization? what kind of file format?

In lascar, whenever you want to deal with results management, you have to go through an OutputMethod.

An OutputMethod is an object used by the Session to indicate how an user would want to process its results.

An other Session parameter for managing output is 'output_steps", used to indicate at which numbers of traces the engine should compute their results

Every time your engines has results to deliver (through the .finalize() method), it goes by the OutputMethod.

lascar already implements a few OutputMethods that will be presented in this scripts (and in the examples/ folder).

We will here demonstrate how to use:

- DictOutputMethod: the results are all stored inside a python dict, with the possibility to save it using pickle
- Hdf5OutputMethod: the results are stored inside a hdf5 file, all attacks are groups, and datasets for each output_steps
- MatPlotLibOutputMethod: the results are displayed on a matplotlib plot, with parameters to indicate the layout (in case of multiple attacks)
- ScoreProgressionOutputMethod: the results are parsed, and the best scores are extracted, and displayed in function of the number of trace
- RankProgressionOutputMethod: the results are parsed, and the rank of the best scores are extracted, and displayed in function of the number of trace

using the previous script of a DPA on simulated AES traces.
This time we will perform 2 DPA in //: one on the lsb of the output of the 3rd sbox, the other on the msb.
